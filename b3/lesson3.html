        <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Figure 3.1.  The exploded view of the engine</strong> </p>
        <p>Even though internal combustion engines look quite simple, they are highly complex machines. There are hundreds of components that have to perform their functions satisfactorily to produce output power. There are two types of engines including spark ignition (SI) and compression-ignition (CI) engine. Let us now go through the important engine components and the nomenclature associated with an engine.</p>
        <p>The major components of the engine and their functions are briefly described below.</p>
        <p>
          <strong>Cylinder Head:</strong> Cylinder head forms the top of the
          combustion chamber. Contains the valves, the passageways for the fuel
          mixture to move in and out of the engine.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Cylinder Block: </strong> The cylinder block is the main
          supporting structure for the various components. The cylinders of a
          multi-cylinder engine is cast as a single unit, called cylinder block.
          The cylinder head is mounted on the cylinder block.
        </p>
        <p>
          The cylinder head and cylinder block are provided with water jackets
          in the case of water-cooling with cooling fins in the case of
          air-cooling. Cylinder head gasket is incorporated between the cylinder
          block and cylinder head. The cylinder head is held tight to the
          cylinder block by number of bolts or studs. The bottom portion of the
          cylinder block is called crankcase. A cover called crankcase, which
          becomes a sump for lubricating oil is fastened to the bottom of the
          crankcase. The inner surface of the cylinder block, which is machined
          and finished accurately to cylindrical shape.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Combustion Chamber:</strong> The space enclosed in the upper
          part of the cylinder, by the cylinder head and the piston top during
          the combustion process, is called the combustion chamber. The
          combustion of fuel and the consequent release of thermal energy
          results in the building up of pressure in this part of the cylinder.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Cylinder: </strong> As the name implies it is a cylindrical
          vessel or space in which the piston makes a reciprocating motion. The
          varying volume created in the cylinder during the operation of the
          engine is filled with the working air fuel mixture and affected by
          different thermodynamic processes. The cylinder is supported in the
          cylinder block.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Piston: </strong> It is a cylindrical component fitted into
          the cylinder forming the moving boundary of the combustion chamber. It
          fits perfectly (snugly) into the cylinder providing a gas-tight space
          with the piston rings and the lubricant. It forms the first link in
          transmitting the gas forces to the output shaft.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Piston Pins: </strong> Piston Pins also known as the wrist
          pin, it connects the piston to the small end of the connecting rod. It
          transfers the force and allows the rod to swing back and forth.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Piston Rings: </strong> Piston rings, fitted into the slots
          around the piston, provide a tight seal between the piston and the
          cylinder wall thus preventing leakage of combustion gases.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Connecting Rod: </strong> It interconnects the piston and the
          crankshaft and transmits the gas forces from the piston to the
          crankshaft. The two ends of the connecting rod are called as small end
          and the big end. Small end is connected to the piston by gudgeon pin
          and the big end is connected to the crankshaft by crankpin.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Crankshaft: </strong> It converts the reciprocating motion of
          the piston into useful rotary motion of the output shaft. In the
          crankshaft of a single cylinder engine there is pair of crank arms and
          balance weights. The balance weights are provided for static and
          dynamic balancing of the rotating system. The crankshaft is enclosed
          in a crankcase.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Flywheel: </strong> The net torque imparted to the crankshaft
          during one complete cycle of operation of the engine fluctuates
          causing a change in the angular velocity of the shaft. In order to
          achieve a uniform torque an inertia mass in the form of a wheel is
          attached to the output shaft and this wheel is called the flywheel.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Inlet Manifold: </strong> The pipe which connects the intake
          system to the inlet valve of the engine and through which air or
          air-fuel mixture is drawn into the cylinder is called the inlet
          manifold.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Exhaust Manifold: </strong> The pipe that connects the exhaust
          system to the exhaust valve of the engine and through which the
          products of combustion escape into the atmosphere is called the
          exhaust manifold.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Valve Train: </strong> A valve train is a series of parts used
          to open and close the intake and exhaust ports. A valve is a movable
          part that opens and closes a passageway. A camshaft controls the
          movement of the valves, causing them to open and close at the proper
          time. Springs are used to help close the valves.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Inlet and Exhaust valves: </strong> Valves are commonly
          mushroom shaped poppet type. They are provided either on the cylinder
          head or on the side of the cylinder for regulating the charge coming
          into the cylinder (inlet valve) and for discharging the products of
          combustion (exhaust valve) from the cylinder.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Camshaft: </strong> The camshaft and its associated parts
          control the opening and closing of the two valves. The associated
          parts are push rods, rocker arms, valve springs and tappets. This
          shaft also provides the drive to the ignition system. The camshaft is
          driven by the crankshaft through timing gears.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Cams: </strong> These are made as integral parts of the
          camshaft and are designed in such a way to open the valves at the
          correct timing and to keep them open for the necessary duration.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Timing Gears: </strong> These gears drive the camshaft from
          the crankshaft.

            Internal Combustion Engines: Powering the Automobile <br></br>
          The engine is the heart of an automobile, providing the power to move the vehicle. Both gasoline and diesel engines are classified as internal combustion engines because the combustion process, where the fuel mixture is burned, occurs inside the engine. This combustion generates thermal energy which is converted into mechanical energy to drive the wheels.</p>
        <p>
          Engine Construction<br></br>
          The engine consists of a cylinder block and a cylinder head. The cylinder block is typically cast from iron or aluminum and houses the cylinders, crankshaft, and water jackets for water-cooling. Some engines may use air-cooling with cooling fins instead. The cylinder head sits on top of the cylinder block, sealed by a cylinder head gasket. It contains the combustion chamber, valves, and valve train. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Engine Operation<br></br>
          Most automobile engines operate on a four-stroke cycle:
          Intake stroke: The intake valve opens, and the piston moves downward, drawing the fuel mixture into the cylinder. <br></br> 
          Compression stroke: The intake valve closes, and the piston moves upward, compressing the fuel mixture.<br></br>
          Power stroke: In a spark ignition (SI) engine, a spark ignites the fuel mixture, while in a compression-ignition (CI) engine (diesel), the heat of compression ignites the fuel. The expanding gases push the piston downward, generating power.<br></br>
          Exhaust stroke: The exhaust valve opens, and the piston moves upward, expelling the exhaust gases.<br></br>
          Engine Components<br></br>
          Piston:  A cylindrical component that moves within the cylinder, transferring gas force to the connecting rod. Piston rings provide a tight seal to prevent leakage of gases.<br></br>
        	Connecting Rod: Connects the piston to the crankshaft. The small end connects to the piston via the piston pin or gudgeon pin (wrist pin), and the big end connects to the crankshaft.<br></br>
          Crankshaft: Converts the linear motion of the piston into rotary motion. It has crank webs to which the connecting rods are attached.<br></br>
          Valve Train: Controls the opening and closing of the valves. This system includes the camshaft, cams, timing gears or drive chain, pushrods, and tappets.<br></br>
          Intake and Exhaust Manifolds: The inlet manifold delivers the fuel mixture to the intake ports of the cylinder head, while the exhaust manifold carries exhaust gases away from the exhaust ports.<br></br>
          Flywheel:  A heavy disc mounted on the crankshaft that helps to smooth out engine operation.<br></br>
          Crankcase: The lower part of the engine that encloses the crankshaft and contains the sump (oil pan), which holds the lubricating oil.<br></br>
